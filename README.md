## Challenges

1. As every journey has some challenges and so was ours. In our team, all we the members were just familiar with each other so it was easy for all of us to communicate and collaborate.

2. This Unit-5 is all about on React js,typescript,MongoDB,backend also. So there were some moments where members were not able to get idea, facing some issues,had a conflict and it was hard for everyone to handle these conflicts.

3. As the Footer parts were common for all the pages so we copied both of them in a single folder and imported them in every code, this was a kind of new method for us and we struggled while doing this step.
